    "*ktrain* is a lightweight wrapper for Keras to help build, train, and deploy neural models in a way that requires a minimal amount of code and a reduced cognitive load. By facilitating the loading and preprocessing of data, tuning learning rates, fitting models with different learning rate policies, inspecting misclassifications, and making predictions on new raw data, *ktrain* allows you to focus more on architecting a good Keras model for your problem.  Inspired by the *fastai* library, it supports:\n",
    "- a **learning rate finder** to help find a good initial learning rate for your model\n",
    "- a variety of demonstrably effective **learning rate schedules** to improve performance including SGDR and Leslie Smith's 1cycle and triangular learning rate policies.\n",
    "-  fast and easy-to-use **pre-canned models** for both text classification (e.g., NBSVM, fastText) and image classification (e.g., ResNet, Wide ResNet, Inception)\n",
    "-  methods to help you **easily load and preprocess text and image data** from a variety of formats\n",
    "- easily inspecting data points that were misclassified to help improve your model\n",
    "- a simple prediction API for **saving and deploying models and data-preprocessing steps** to easily make predictions on new raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by importing the *ktrain* module.  The *ktrain* library contains sub-modules to handle specific types of data. Currently, we have the *ktrain.vision* module for image classification and the *ktrain.text* module for text classification. Additional sub-modules will be added over time for tackling various other types of problems.  We will import the *vision* module here, as this tutorial example involves image classification."

The **data_aug** parameter can be used to employ [data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04621).

    "Additional arguments can be supplied to further configure data augmentation.  See [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/#imagedatagenerator-class) for a full set of augmentation parameters.  Since the defaults are designed for \"normal-sized\" photos and may be too aggressive for little 28x28 MNIST images, we have reduced some of the values slightly. We have also set the image size to 28x28 and the color mode to grayscale.  If using alternative values for these parameters, the image will automatically be adjusted (e.g., resized, converted from 1-channel to 3-channel image).  This is necessary, for instance, if a particular model only supports 3-channel images ('rgb' color_mode) or a minimum image size (e.g., 32x32). The defaults are ```target_size=(224,224)``` and ```color_mode='rgb'```, which tend to work well for most other image classification problems."

    "## Training with Learning Rate Schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "Varying the learning rate cyclically during training has been shown to be [effective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186) and a good general practice.  *ktrain* allows you to easily employ a variety of demonstrably effective learning rate policies during training. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a [triangular learning rate policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186) available via the ```autofit``` method\n",
    "* a [1cycle policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820) available via the ```fit_onecycle``` method\n",
    "* an [SGDR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983) (Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restart) schedule available using the ```fit``` method by supplying a *cycle_len* argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```autofit``` and ```fit_onecycle``` methods tend to be good choices that produce pleasing results.  For more information on learning rate schedules, see the [*ktrain* tutorial notebook on tuning learning rates](https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-02-tuning-learning-rates.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```autofit``` method in *ktrain* employs a triangular learning rate schedule and uses the supplied learning rate as the maximum learning rate.  The ```autofit``` method accepts two primary arguments. The first (required) is the learning rate (**lr**) to be used, which can be found using the learning rate finder above. The second is optional and indicates the number of epochs (**epochs**) to train.  If **epochs** is not supplied as a second argument, then ```autofit``` will train until the validation loss no longer improves after a certain period. This period can be configured using the **early_stopping** argument.  The ```autofit``` method will also reduce the learning rate when validation loss no longer improves, which can be configured using the reduce_on_plateau argument to ```autofit```.  At the end of training, the weights producing the lowest validation loss are automatically loaded into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```autofit``` method also accepts a **checkpoint_folder** argument representing the path to a directory. If supplied, the weights of the model after each epoch will be saved to this folder.  Thus, the model state of any epoch can be easily restored using the ```learner.model.load_weights``` method, if the final validation accuracy is not desired. In this case, the final accuracy is quite satisfactory for this model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, this learning rate scheme achieves an accuracy of **99.64%** after 10 epochs despite the simplicity of our model. \n"
