    "\n",
    "As of v0.27.x, ktrain supports causal inference using [meta-learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03461). We will use the well-studied [Adults Census](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaiya/ktrain/master/ktrain/tests/tabular_data/adults.csv) dataset from the UCI ML repository, which is census data from the early to mid 1990s.  The objective is to estimate how much earning a PhD increases the probability of making over $50K in salary.  This dataset is simply being used as a simple demonstration example.  Unlike conventional supervised machine learning, there is typically no ground truth for causal inference models, unless you're using a simulated dataset.  So, we will simply check our estimates to see if they agree with intuition for illustration purposes in addition to inspecting robustness.\n",

    "Let's begin by loading the dataset and creating a binary treatment (1 for PhD and 0 for no PhD)."

Since this example is simply being used for illustration purposes, we will ignore the `fnlwgt` column, which represents the number of people the census believes the entry represents.  In practice, one might incorporate domain knowledge when choosing which variables to include and ignore.  For instance, variables thought to be common effects of both the treatment and outcome might be excluded as [colliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(statistics)).  Finally, we will also exclude the education-related columns as they are already captured in the treatment. "

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, there is no ground truth for this problem to validate our estimates.  In the cells above, we simply inspected the estimates to see if they correspond to our intuition on what should happen.  Another approach to validating causal estimates is to evaluate robustness to various data manipulations (i.e., sensitivity analysis). For instance, the Placebo Treatment test replaces the treatment with a random covariate.  We see below that this causes our estimate to drop to near zero, which is expected and exactly what we want. Such tests might be used to compare different models."
