    "In this notebook, we build a practical, end-to-end Question-Answering (QA) system with BERT in rougly 3 lines of code.  We will treat a corpus of text documents as a knowledge base to which we can ask questions and retrieve exact answers using [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). This goes beyond simplistic keyword searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will use the [20 Newsgroup dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) as the text corpus.  As a collection of newsgroup postings which contains an abundance of opinions and debates, the corpus is not ideal as a knowledgebase.  It is better to use fact-based documents such as Wikipedia articles or even news articles.  However, this dataset will suffice for this example.\n",

    "For documents sets that are too large to be loaded into a Python list, you can use `SimpleQA.index_from_folder`, which will crawl a folder and index all plain text documents (e.g.,, `.txt` files) by default.  If your documents are in formats like `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.pptx`, you can supply the `use_text_extraction=True` argument to `index_from_folder`, which will use the [textract](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to extract text from different file types and index this text into the search engine for answer rerieval.  You can also manually convert them to `.txt` files with the  `ktrain.text.textutils.extract_copy` or tools like [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or [textract](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  \n",

These values can be changed to speedup indexing as arguments to `index_from_list` or `index_from_folder`.  See the [whoosh documentation](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/batch.html) for more information on these parameters and how to use them to speedup indexing.

The latter can be done with *ktrain* using:\n",

Note that `breakup_docs=True` will slightly **slow indexing** (i.e., STEP 1), but **speed up answer retrieval** (i.e., STEP 3 below).  A second way to speed up answer-retrieval is to increase `batch_size` in STEP 3 if using a GPU, which will be discussed later.\n",

    "### The `batch_size` Argument to `ask`\n",
    "\n",
    "As of **ktrain v0.22.x**, the `ask` method uses `batch_size=8` by default, which means 8 question-document pairs are fed to the model at a time.  Older versions of **ktrain** used a `batch_size` of 1.  A `batch_size` of 8 speeds of answer-retrieval.  If you experience an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error, you can reduce the batch size by setting the `batch_size` argument to `ask` (e.g., `batch_size=1`). Reducing `batch_size` may also be beneficial if `ask` is being invoked using a **CPU** instead of **GPU**.\n",

    "### Deploying the QA System\n",

    "### Using `SimpleQA` as a Simple Search Engine\n",

    "\n",

    "### Connecting the QA System to an Existing Search Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we created and populated our own search index of documents.  As mentioned above, **ktrain** uses [whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/querylang.html) internally for this.  It is relatively easy to use the **ktrain** `qa` module with an existing, pre-populated search engine like [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) or [Elastic Search](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). You can simply subclass the `QA` class and override the `search` method:\n",

    "qa = MyCustomQA()\n",
    "qa.ask('What is the best search engine?')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, as mentioned above, this will work best when documents stored in the search engine are broken into smaller contexts (e.g., paragraphs), if they are not already."
