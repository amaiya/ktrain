    "\n",
    "As stated above, the `ZeroShotClassifier` is implemented using Natural Language Inference (NLI).  That is, the document is treated as a **premise**, and each label is treated as a **hypothesis**.  To predict labels, an NLI model is used to predict whether or not each label is entailed by the premise.  By default, the template used for the hypothesis is of the form `\"This text is about <label>.\"`, where `<label>` is replaced with a candidate label (e.g., `politics`, `sports`, etc.).  Although this works well for many text classification problems such as the topic classification examples above, we can customize the template with the `nli_template` parameter if necessary.  For instance, if predicting sentiment of movie reviews, we might change the template as follows:"
