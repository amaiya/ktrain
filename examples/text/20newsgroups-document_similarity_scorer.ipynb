    "Our `scorer` assigns a score to each document, where  higher scores indicate a  higher degree of similarity to technology-related seed docments.  The `scorer` implements a decision function to make binary decisions on similarity such that documents with positive scores are deemed as similar and negative scores are deemed dissimilar. We've used this to create  a prediction of 1 for similar and 0 for dissimilar.  This identifies 377 documents as similar.   The `scorer`, however, employs a One-Class classifier, which tends to be more strict.  That is, there are likely documents with negative scores close to zero that are also similar.  Let's look at these."

How much closer to the source can you get?\\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by God\", \\nliterally means \"God-breathed\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \\ninto the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is \\none that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and \\nincompleteness of \"inspired by God\".\\n\\n\\nThat's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.

       "      <td>I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\\ntime we need him most.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \\nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\\northodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.</td>\n",

       "1  \\n \\nFirst of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.\\nThe author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but \"(at best) \\nsecond-hand\".\\n\\n\\t\"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching\\n\\t Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and\\n\\t he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul,\\n\\t why are you persecuting Me?\"  And he said, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\"  And\\n\\t He said, \"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .\"\\n\\t\\t(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)\\n\\nPaul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He\\nbecame closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were \\nfollowers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.\\n\\n\\nI agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you \\nthe Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know\\nit is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?\\n(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)\\n\\n\\nThe Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?\\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by God\", \\nliterally means \"God-breathed\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \\ninto the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is \\none that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and \\nincompleteness of \"inspired by God\".\\n\\n\\nThat's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a \\nbook written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks \\nof life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior\\nhistoricity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings \\nof the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.\\n\\n\\nJesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.\\n\\n\\nPlease rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your\\ncurrent belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not\\nonly did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards\\nto C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?\\n\\tIn conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based\\non gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.  \\nThe Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.\\n\\tAbout your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the\\nwriters, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the \\nleast without the Spirit's guidance:\\n\\n\\t\"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit \\n\\tsearches all things, even the depths of God.\"  (1 Cor 2:10, NAS)\\n \\nPeace and may God guide us in wisdom.\\n\\n+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=\\nCarter C.

       "2  I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\\ntime we need him most.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \\nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\\northodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.  "

Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in\\non the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.\\n\\n\\nAhem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be\\nPolitically Correct to contend so.\\n\\n\\nIt will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an\\noperational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of\\nthe promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's\\nthe *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,\\nto develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  \\n\\nThere is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling\\naway, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any\\nzeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for\\nthis must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual\\nbillions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will\\nno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:\\n\\nDC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping\\ndevelopment costs low and flying incremental \"X-plane\" hardware.\\nIt's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a\\ncomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would\\nhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s\\nAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or\\nbuilding the DC-Y.\\n\\nI'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any\\nexpansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for\\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\\nthe DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\\nprospect too depressing to bear.\\n\\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\\ndirection.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for\\nsmall payloads.)\\n\\nI read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are\\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\\nof them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's\\nworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an\\nassembly line.\\n\\n[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]\\n\\nStrawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. \\nThe DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which\\nincludes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle\\noperations, as well as the \"bird in the hand\" argument your common\\nsense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the\\nShuttle, not instead of it.\\n\\nAlso, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful\\nfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.\\n\\n\\nIf a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,\\nrather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford\\nmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites\\ninstead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little\\noutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of\\nbegging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able\\nto convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a\\nbig difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?</td>\n",

       "4754  Ken:\\n\\nYour arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big\\nBoys if you're tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in\\non the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.\\n\\n\\nAhem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be\\nPolitically Correct to contend so.\\n\\n\\nIt will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an\\noperational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of\\nthe promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's\\nthe *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,\\nto develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  \\n\\nThere is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling\\naway, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any\\nzeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for\\nthis must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual\\nbillions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will\\nno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:\\n\\nDC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping\\ndevelopment costs low and flying incremental \"X-plane\" hardware.\\nIt's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a\\ncomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would\\nhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s\\nAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or\\nbuilding the DC-Y.\\n\\nI'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any\\nexpansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for\\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\\nthe DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\\nprospect too depressing to bear.\\n\\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\\ndirection.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for\\nsmall payloads.)\\n\\nI read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are\\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\\nof them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's\\nworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an\\nassembly line.\\n\\n[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]\\n\\nStrawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. \\nThe DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which\\nincludes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle\\noperations, as well as the \"bird in the hand\" argument your common\\nsense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the\\nShuttle, not instead of it.\\n\\nAlso, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful\\nfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.\\n\\n\\nIf a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,\\nrather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford\\nmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites\\ninstead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little\\noutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of\\nbegging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able\\nto convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a\\nbig difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?  \n",

       "4757  \\nFirstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap\\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\\nThe other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\\nthe cold).\\n\\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
