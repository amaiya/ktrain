### New:
- N/A

### Changed
- N/A/

### Fixed:
- prevent `transformer` tokenizers from being pickled during `predictor.save`, as it causes problems for

### New:
- support for Zero-Shot Topic Classification via the `text.ZeroShotClassifier`.

### Changed
- N/A/

### Fixed:
- Added the `procs`, `limitmb`, and `multisegment` argumetns to `index_from_list` and `index_from_folder` method in `text.SimpleQA`
  to speedup indexing when necessary.  Supplying `multisegment=True` speeds things up significantly, for example. Defaults, however, are
  the same as before. Users must explicitly change values if desiring a speedup.

## 0.15.3 (2020-05-28)

### New:
- N/A

### Changed
- [**breaking change**] The `multilabel` argument in `text.Transformer` constructor was moved to `Transformer.get_classifier` and now correctly allows
  users to forcibly configure model for multilabel task regardless as to what data suggests. However, it is recommended to leave this value as `None`.
- The methods `predictor.save`, `ktrain.load_predictor`, `learner.save_model`, `learner.load_model` all now accept a path to folder where
  all files (e.g., model file, `.preproc` file) will be saved. If path does not exist, it will be created.
   This should not be a breaking change as the `load*` methods will still look for files in the old location if model or predictor was saved
  using an older version of *ktrain*.

### Fixed:
- N/A





## 0.15.2 (2020-05-15)

### New:
- N/A

### Changed
